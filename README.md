# GUI-Internet-DataBase-Visualization

This was the preview of a business proposal for Fractal Consulting and Galanet, two IT companies from Venezuela. It involved GUI built with Tkinter for the management of their clients database.

The functions shown in this preview are finding disposable IPs for new clients in a given node and finding client information, both functions shown in separated windows. Before the GUI a database was built from an excel file provided by the company, the chosen module for this was sqlite3, then this database served as the data provider inside the GUI, displaying scrollable tables for each functionality.

The proposal involved the development of new functionalities, such as:
-Creation of new nodes in the database.
-Adding new client information.
-Showing specific performance indexes in any given node.
